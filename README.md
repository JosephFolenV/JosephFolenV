Hi! My name is Joseph Folen and I am a Junior Computer Engineering student. I have been involved in multiple projects this year on my journey to grow my skills across different tech stacks. I'm looking for opportunities to grow my skills in software development and hardware design through hands-on experience, so that I can use my creativity to improve the world however I can.
